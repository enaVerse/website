# enaVerse website

The website is pretty easy to edit: 

1. clone the enaverse/website repo, 
2. pull off a branch to work on,  
3. edit the config.toml for the front page and/or create folders and md files in the content folder, and 
4. when all your edits are done, merge into master and 
5. then push to github.

Travis-CI (configured via .travis.yml) will build and deploy the site to the enverse.github.io repository, which will then be automatically hosted via githubâ€™s servers.

New themes can be found at http://gohugo.io/. 

Any questions, contact MKLau.
