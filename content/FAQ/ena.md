# What is ENA?

ENA is a method for analysing models to provide a
view of the structure and dynamics of ecosystems.

## Why use it?
Systems are comprised of complex relationships often among many
interacting parts (e.g., a food web). ENA functions like a
"macroscope" allowing you to quantify interesting aspects of the
system of interest.
